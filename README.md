# hello

– ***helloSystem***. 

A desktop system for creators that focuses on simplicity, elegance, and usability. 

[Based on FreeBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS#/media/File:Unix_timeline.en.svg). Less, but better!

For mere mortals. Welcoming to switchers from macOS.

Not just a theme. Not a clone of anything, but something with which the long-time Mac user should feel instantly comfortable.

The latest technologies, without the complexities of Linux distributions.

Without lockdown. Without Big Brother. The user in full control.

### Experimental live images

https://github.com/helloSystem/ISO/ – `.iso` files can be written to USB drives. 

Boot your computer from one of these drives, or boot a virtual machine (e.g. VirtualBox) from an `.iso` – take an early look at helloSystem without installing to your computer.
