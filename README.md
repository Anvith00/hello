# hello

![](https://github.com/helloSystem/hello/blob/master/branding/computer-hello.png?raw=true)

Desktop system for creators with focus on simplicity, elegance, and usability. Based on FreeBSD. Less, but better!

A system for "mere mortals", welcoming to switchers from the Mac.

With the latest technologies underneath.

Without the complexities of Linux distributions.

Without lockdown. With the user in full control.

Without Big Brother. https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/

__NOT__ just a "theme". Definitely __not__ a "clone" of anything. But something that long-time Mac users would instantly feel at home on.

## Why the need?
