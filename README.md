Desktop system for creators with focus on simplicity, elegance, and usability. Based on FreeBSD. Less, but better!

With the latest technologies underneath.

Without the complexities of Linux distributions.

Without lockdown. With the user in full control. 

__NOT__ just a "theme". Definitely __not__ a "clone" of anything. But something that long-time Mac users would instantly feel at home on.
