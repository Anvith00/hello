### Please see https://hellosystem.github.io/ for documentation.

This repository is where developers and interested advanced users brainstorm on __helloSystem__. If you are looking for documentation, Live ISO downloads, and other _practical_ information, look at https://hellosystem.github.io/.

## What?

A desktop system for creators that focuses on simplicity, elegance, and usability.

Following the published [Human Interface Guidelines](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/573097), and [First Principles of Interaction Design](https://asktog.com/atc/principles-of-interaction-design/) liberally re-interpreted for today.

[Based on FreeBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS#/media/File:Unix_timeline.en.svg).

For mere mortals. Welcoming to switchers from macOS.  Not just a theme. Not a clone of anything, but something with which the long-time Mac user should feel instantly comfortable. The latest technologies, without the complexities of Linux distributions. Without lockdown. Without Big Brother. The user in full control.

Less, but better!

## Why?

Because we used to like the Mac, since 1984. But it's increasingly getting... difficult:

* Because according to Edward Snowden, [Apple Just Declared War on Your Privacy](https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/all-seeing-i) (all the while talking about "privacy", "security", "trusted")
* Because Apple has become Big Brother with considering [Client-Side Scanning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07450), distrusting its users and treating them like potential criminals, searching through users' data
* Because we want "Personal Digital Sovereignty", in other words: be in full control over what our devices are doing
* Because Apple has become ["anti-hacking"](https://twitter.com/jeremy_soller/status/1448318637488566273)
* Because we want to run apps from "unidentified developers" that need no blessing by the operating system vendor and no workarounds like https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/textedit-gatekeeper.html
* [Gatekeeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatekeeper_(macOS)) ("It forced Mac developers, who had previously been legally free, to sign a strict contract." [Source](https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1440735016611246086))
* @antranigv on *macOS to FreeBSD migration a.k.a why I left macOS* https://antranigv.am/weblog_en/posts/macos_to_freebsd/
* https://hardware.substack.com/p/falling-out-of-love-with-apple-part1
* https://medium.com/@probonopd/bring-back-the-ease-of-80s-and-90s-personal-computing-393738c5e2a1 (Medium article written by me)
* https://memoryprotection.show/blog/episode-24 ("It has become very user-hostile.")
* Because what used to be simple is becoming increasingly difficult. Example: Install a kernel extension https://twitter.com/CastIrony/status/1444077820041318400 - probably the process doesn't even work on "managed" devices where some central IT department thinks it knows best which kexts the users "need". Lock in and lock down
* https://bombich.com/blog/2021/05/19/beyond-bootable-backups-adapting-recovery-strategies-evolving-platform (If the soldered-in SSD fails, you cannot boot from external bootable media, because "security")
* Because we want all software to be "sideloaded" rather than coming from monopolistic stores https://www.lunduke.com/2021/07/google-goes-to-war-against-sideloading/
* Because we disagree with phone-home, tracking, activation. Apparently it is not necesseary to [activate](https://twitter.com/EggFreckles/status/1439621327472762888) Macs. Has the NSA ordered this "feature" so that they can track people even better?
* Because used Apple devices have to be thrown away if they are "FMIP locked" (which regularly happens with previously company-owned devices) https://twitter.com/TWArecycles/status/1444549353335509003
* Because Apple user interfaces are becoming less and less Mac-like (as measured by the original Human Interface Guidelines). Example: [The Tragedy of Safari 15 for Mac’s ‘Tabs’](https://twitter.com/daringfireball/status/1444092268344840197)
* Because Apple is using [ideologically charged, plain wrong spelling](https://twitter.com/pkWebService/status/1452750252327505922/photo/1), which is partisan propaganda and is clearly rejected by the majority of the population
* Because Apple is watering the desktop down with inferior mobile UX and hybrid apps ("Catalyst") that don't behave like real mouse-centric ("AppKit") desktop apps
