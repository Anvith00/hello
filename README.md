Desktop system for creators with focus on simplicity, elegance, and usability. Based on FreeBSD. Less, but better!

With the latest technologies underneath.

Without the complexities of Linux distributions.

__NOT__ just a "theme". Definitely __not__ a "clone" of anything. But something that long-time Mac users would instantly feel at home on.
